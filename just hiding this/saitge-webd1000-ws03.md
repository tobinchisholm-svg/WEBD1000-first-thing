# Guided Workshop: Planning Your Website ‚Äì Content Inventory & Sitemap

## Why This Matters

Before writing any code, you need a plan. A website is like a building:

* The **content inventory** is your list of materials.
* The **sitemap** is your blueprint for how everything fits together.

This exercise will guide you through creating both.

## Step 1: Define Your Website Idea

**Task:** Choose a website idea that matters to you. Examples:

* A **portfolio site** to showcase your projects
* A **club or community site** for events and updates
* A **small business site** for services or products

üëâ Write your idea below (2‚Äì3 sentences):

* What is the purpose of your site?
* Who is your main audience?
* What should visitors be able to do?

**My Website Idea:**

```

## Step 2: Create a Content Inventory

Your content inventory is a list of everything your site will include.

### How to do it:

1. **List your pages**: Start with *Home, About, Contact*. Add more as needed (e.g., Projects, Blog, Services).
2. **Add content items** under each page: text, images, forms, videos, etc.
3. **Mark priority**: High = must have, Medium = nice to have, Low = optional.

### Example (Portfolio Site):

| Page/Section | Content Item          | Type  | Source           | Priority | Notes               |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Homepage     | Welcome message       | Text  | Write myself     | High     | Keep to 2 sentences |
| Homepage     | Headshot photo        | Image | Personal photo   | High     | Crop and resize     |
| About        | Short bio             | Text  | Write myself     | High     | Use plain language  |
| Projects     | Screenshot of project | Image | From GitHub repo | High     | Must be compressed  |

### Now You Try:

Fill in your own **Content Inventory Table** below.

| Page/Section | Content Item | Type (Text, Image, Video, Form) | Source (Where from?) | Priority (High/Med/Low) | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
|              |              |                                 |                      |                         |       |
|              |              |                                 |                      |                         |       |
|              |              |                                 |                      |                         |       |

*(Add more rows as needed.)*

## Step 3: Draw Your Sitemap

A sitemap shows how your pages connect.

### Rules of Thumb:

* Keep **5‚Äì7 items** in your top navigation.
* Group related pages (e.g., ‚ÄúAbout ‚Üí Team‚Äù).
* Labels should be **clear and consistent** (don‚Äôt mix ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho I Am‚Äù).

### Example (Portfolio Site):

```
Home
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ About
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Projects
 ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Project 1
 ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Project 2
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Blog
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Contact
```

### Your Turn:

üëâ Use **boxes for pages** and **arrows for links**.
Options:

* Draw on paper and take a photo.
* Use a free tool: draw\.io, Lucidchart, or Miro.

**Sketch Space:**

Answer these reflection prompts in 3‚Äì4 sentences:

1. How did your target audience shape your sitemap?
2. Was any part of your site hard to organize? Why?
3. How will you make sure your site structure supports accessibility?

**My Reflection:**
